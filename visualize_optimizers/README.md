I've tried here to visualize different optimization algorithm from the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.
Algorithms are implemented in NumPy from scratch, but visualization comes from https://github.com/snnclsr/visualize_optimizers.
I have readapted part of the visualization algorithms to make testing easier and to facilitate understanding.
